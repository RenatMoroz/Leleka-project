# 🕊️👶 Leleka Project

Our team developed a Ukrainian web application for pregnant women, designed to track pregnancy progress, baby development, and personal notes.

The application includes:

Registration, login, and onboarding with due date input, avatar selection, and baby’s gender (app theme automatically changes: pink, blue, or neutral)
Personalized dashboard with greeting, current pregnancy week, countdown, and daily tasks
Interactive Journey showing weekly baby development, tips for mothers, and tabs for “Baby Development” and “Mom’s Body”
Feelings diary (Diary) with full create, edit, delete functionality, emotion selection, and detailed entry view
Secure logout with confirmation and state clearance
The app is responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop, follows a mobile-first approach, uses CSS Modules for styling, Next.js App Router for routing, Zustand for state management, Formik with Yup for forms, React Query for data fetching, and displays loaders and error notifications.
